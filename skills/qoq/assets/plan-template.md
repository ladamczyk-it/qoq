# Plan template

Copy this structure for every new plan file. The fixed shape is what lets `qoq
execute` resume a plan across sessions, and what lets a cold subagent trust that
"Status" and "Definition of done" mean the same thing in every ticket it's ever
handed. Fill in the `<…>` placeholders; don't add or remove sections. The one
exception is **External**, which the `--tool` export writes onto milestones and
tickets after approval — and which `qoq execute --source` writes as it imports
them the other way. It's simply absent on a plan that never met a tracker.

```markdown
# <Feature Name> Implementation Plan

**Goal:** <one sentence>
**Architecture:** <2-3 sentences>
**Requirements source:** <link or short description of what was decomposed>
**Commands:** build `<full build command>` · test `<full test command>`
**Tool:** local | jira | linear | trello · <destination — project key, team, or
board; omit the whole field on a local plan>
**Plan status:** draft | approved | in-progress | complete

## Completed

<!-- Absent on a fresh plan. Each delivered milestone's full text moves to
     <plan-name>.completed.md and leaves one block here. -->

### Milestone <N>: <Name> — delivered <YYYY-MM-DD>

**Delivered:** <one sentence: what exists now that didn't before>
**Tickets:** <id> <title> `<commit>` · <id> <title> `<commit>`
**Gate evidence:** refactor `<the verdict — clean, or what it found and what was
done>` · suite `<the full build + suite result, as reported>`
**Decisions that outlive this milestone:** none | <what later work is built on>
**Open advisories:** none | <non-blocking findings still true>
**Full detail:** [<plan-name>.completed.md](<plan-name>.completed.md)

---

## Milestone 1: <Name>

**Size:** S | M | L | XL
**Goal:** <what this milestone delivers on its own — should be independently
shippable/testable>
**Depends on:** none | Milestone <N>
**Contracts:** none | <the interface this milestone's tickets share — inline when
small (a type, a payload shape, an error shape), or a path when the project
already keeps `openapi.yaml` / `.proto` / a zod schema>
**Scenarios:**

<!-- Journeys, in the user's language, written in Phase 1 from what the grill
     settled. Not assertions — see the field note. -->

- **Given** <the state the user is in> **When** <what they do> **Then** <what
  they observe>

**External:** <added by the export beat only — the epic/milestone/list it was
raised as; absent otherwise>

### Ticket 1.1: <Title>

- **Status:** todo | in-progress | blocked | done
- **Size:** XS | S | M — anything larger is an unfinished decomposition; split it
- **Complexity:** trivial | mechanical | moderate | judgment-heavy
- **Agent tier:** `haiku` | `sonnet` | <the session's own model ID, for
  judgment-heavy> — every ticket is delegated; the tier is passed explicitly
- **Estimate:** `<tags>` · stack `<stack>` · <baseline | confident | escalate |
  split> <misses>/<attempts> <· tier haiku→sonnet> — from
  `scripts/estimate.mjs`; `qoq execute` reports the outcome back against exactly
  these tags and the **Agent tier** above
- **Escalation:** none | <failed tier> ×<attempts> → re-dispatched at <tier>
- **Depends on:** none | Ticket <id>
- **Needs approval:** none | <new dependency and why it's needed>
- **Files:**
  - Create: `exact/path/to/file.ts`
  - Modify: `exact/path/to/existing.ts:120-140`
  - Test: `exact/path/to/file.test.ts`

**Context:** Everything a zero-context subagent needs to do this without asking
questions — relevant types/interfaces, the existing pattern to follow, why this
ticket exists. No "similar to Ticket 1.3" — restate what's needed.

**Acceptance criteria:**

<!-- Written as assertions, not tasks. `qoq execute` opens this ticket by
     transcribing each one into a failing spec before any implementation, so
     each must describe observable behaviour a spec can assert today. Each box is
     ticked at `done` and gains its evidence pointer — see the field note. -->

- [ ] <a 6th request inside 60s returns 429> — `<spec/file.ts::test name>`
- [ ] <an expired token yields 401 with code TOKEN_EXPIRED> —
      `<spec/file.ts::test name>`

**Definition of done:** <!-- the orchestrator's checklist, not the developer's;
     the dispatch carries Context, Files, Acceptance criteria and the milestone's
     Contracts only -->

- [ ] `qoq fix <files above>` → PASS — Gate 1, run from the orchestrating thread,
      since the developer can't dispatch it
- [ ] `qoq-test-reviewer` over the spec files → `APPROVED` — Gate 2, after Gate 1
      because `qoq fix` rewrites formatting. No ticket is `done` without it: a
      ticket whose tests assert nothing files a `success` with the estimator and
      leaves downstream work built on a behaviour nothing pins
- [ ] Every acceptance criterion ticked with its evidence pointer, taken from the
      reviewer's criterion → assertion mapping
- [ ] Change committed after both gates; hash recorded in **Commit** below
- [ ] Status set to `done`; advisories (if any) noted below

**Advisories:** <filled in after the gates run, or "none">

- **Log:**
  <!-- Orchestrator-written, append-only. One line per transition; no schema
       beyond a timestamp and what happened. -->
  - `<YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM>` dispatched @ <tier> (attempt <n>)
  - `<YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM>` qoq fix FAIL — <what>
  - `<YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM>` re-dispatched (attempt <n>)
  - `<YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM>` qoq fix PASS · tests approved
  - `<YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM>` done `<hash>`

**Commit:** <filled in after commit — short hash, or a link if the remote is a
known host; "none" until then>

**External:** <added by the export beat only — the issue key or card URL this
ticket was raised as; absent otherwise>

### Ticket 1.2: ...

### Milestone 1 — Definition of done

- [ ] All tickets above are `done`
- [ ] `qoq refactor --decisions auto <union of every ticket's Files above>` →
      clean. This is the milestone's refactor beat, and the only scope
      where cross-ticket findings — duplication, a now-dead export, three tickets
      that each picked a different shape — are visible at all. Pass the union
      explicitly; bare, it widens to the whole project
- [ ] Project's full build + full test suite green (the Commands header above,
      not the scoped variants a ticket gate uses)
- [ ] Both results written into the summary block's **Gate evidence** — what the
      refactor found and what the suite reported, not "green"
- [ ] Milestone archived: full text moved to `<plan-name>.completed.md`, summary
      block left under `## Completed`, downstream tickets' **Context** updated
      with anything this milestone actually established

## The archive file

`./plans/<same-plan-name>.completed.md` holds the milestones that have shipped,
verbatim as they were at delivery — tickets, context, acceptance criteria,
advisories, commits. It's append-only history, not a working document: nothing in
it is ever re-planned or re-gated.

```markdown
# <Feature Name> — completed milestones

Archived from [<plan-name>.md](<plan-name>.md). Append-only.

## Milestone 1: <Name> — delivered <YYYY-MM-DD>

## Field notes

- **Acceptance criteria** are the field this whole template turns on. They're
  machine-facing: the implementing agent transcribes them one-to-one into failing
  assertions before writing any code. "Add rate limiting to the auth routes" is a
  title, not a criterion — it leaves the red beat with nothing to transcribe and
  the agent ends up inventing the assertion it should have been handed. If a
  criterion can't be asserted before the implementation exists, the ticket isn't
  decomposed yet. Each one is derived from a **Scenario** — a criterion with no
  parent journey is one somebody invented.
- **Evidence pointer** is the `spec/file.ts::test name` written beside a
  criterion when the ticket reaches `done`, and it comes from
  `qoq-test-reviewer`'s mapping — never from the orchestrator's own reading of
  the diff, which is the reading the gate exists to replace. Without it a
  delivered plan reads identically to an undelivered one, and "criteria met" is a
  claim nobody can check without re-opening the diff.
- **Contracts** sits on the **milestone**, not the ticket: its tickets share one
  interface — one implements it, another asserts it — and milestone 3's schema
  has no business in milestone 1's dispatch context. It's written in Phase 2 from
  `qoq-architect`'s output, and `qoq execute` passes it verbatim into every
  dispatch. `none` is a normal, common value; say it out loud rather than
  inventing a schema section, which is what a mandatory field otherwise grows.
  The one rule on the content: it has to be something a spec can assert against,
  the same test acceptance criteria already pass.
- **Scenarios** are journeys, and a journey is not an acceptance criterion. A
  criterion is one ticket's assertion — "a 6th request inside 60s returns 429".
  A scenario spans tickets — "**Given** a signed-in user who has just hit the
  limit, **When** they retry after the window, **Then** the request succeeds and
  the counter has reset". Nothing else in the plan holds the second, and a
  milestone's whole claim is that it's independently shippable, which is a
  statement about journeys rather than about assertions. Structured prose, not
  Gherkin: the intended consumer is a model and needs no formal grammar, while
  real Gherkin invites someone to point Cucumber at it and then wants step
  definitions nobody asked for. More than about six means the milestone is too
  big — the same test the `XL` rule applies, reached from the other direction.
- **Log** is orchestrator-written and append-only — one line per transition, a
  timestamp and what happened, no schema beyond that. It exists because `Status`
  says where a ticket is and nothing says how it got there: two gate rejections
  and an escalation are invisible in a `done` ticket otherwise, and they're what
  a resume, and the user, read a plan's history from.
- **Commands** are the project's _full_ build and test commands, copied from the
  discovery record at approval. The milestone gate runs them, possibly days later
  in a session with no memory of this one. There's no fallback to reading
  `package.json` — if these are missing, the plan was never properly approved.
- **Complexity** rates the model tier and nothing else. Every ticket runs the
  identical steps; an inflated rating costs a bigger model and no extra passes.
- **Plan status** tracks the whole plan; **Ticket status** tracks one ticket.
  A plan can be `in-progress` while individual tickets are still `todo`.
- **Estimate** is the calibration bucket this ticket's size and tier were drawn
  from, and it has to survive into execution: `qoq execute` reports the outcome
  back against these exact tags, this stack and the **Agent tier** above, and an
  outcome filed against anything else grades a decision nobody made. The target
  is 90–100%; below it the tier has already been bumped a rung, above it the
  estimator is proposing one rung down to check the work isn't being
  over-served. Either move is surfaced at approval, because whether this ticket
  really is the same shape as the ones behind that number is the user's call.
- **Escalation** stays `none` unless a dispatch actually handed the ticket back
  and it was re-dispatched a rung up. Fill it in even when the escalated run then
  passes — it's how a resume knows not to retry the tier that already failed, and
  how the user sees which tickets were mis-rated. The ladder stops at the
  orchestrator's own model; no tier above it exists to record.
- **Needs approval** is only present when decomposition surfaced a genuine
  new-dependency need. Omit it otherwise rather than leaving a dangling field on
  every ticket.
- **Files** paths are exact, not descriptive ("the auth module" is not a path). A
  subagent picking up a ticket cold should never have to grep the repo to find
  out what "the relevant file" means. There's no separate test-only ticket type
  for feature work — a ticket that ships a feature lists its spec files here and
  carries them as its own red beat.
- **Size** stops at `M`. There is no `L` ticket: more than 5 files, or crossing a
  subsystem boundary, means the decomposition isn't done. Milestones use
  `S`/`M`/`L`/`XL`, where `XL` means it should be its own plan.
- **Context** is the field most often shortchanged. "Similar to Ticket 1.3" or
  "handle edge cases" is a placeholder — go back and write the actual content.
- **Commit** is only ever filled in after a real commit exists. Never guess a
  hash.
- **Tool** and **External** exist for the two beats that cross into a tracker
  (`references/export.md`): `qoq plan --tool jira|linear|trello` raises the
  milestones and tickets there after approval, and `qoq execute --source` reads
  a milestone back out into a file shaped like this one. **External** is what
  makes both re-runnable — on export an item that already has one is skipped, so
  a second run after a crash adds what's missing instead of duplicating forty
  issues into a shared project; on an imported plan it's the address the run
  writes each ticket's status label and commit back to. A local plan carries
  neither field, which is the point: the file is the state in either direction,
  and `qoq execute` never treats a tracker as one.
- **Completed** is absent from a fresh plan and grows one short block per
  delivered milestone, so the plan shrinks as work lands. If a block starts
  turning into a narrative, move the detail to the archive file. **Decisions that
  outlive this milestone** is the one line worth real thought — it's what a later
  milestone would otherwise contradict.
