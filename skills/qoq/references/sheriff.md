# `qoq sheriff` — is this change introducing anything fishy?

`qoq-sheriff` reads a change for logic-level security problems and returns typed
findings; what it looks for lives in `agents/qoq-sheriff.md`. This file is the
main thread's side: scope, dispatch, routing, the remediation loop, and what gets
recorded. **The analysis is delegated; every decision stays here** — the agent
can't stop to ask, so asking, accepting and remediating are this thread's.

## Scope

```
/qoq sheriff                         # files changed since the merge-base with the default branch
/qoq sheriff src/auth 'src/**/*.ts'  # snapshot: those paths, as they stand
/qoq sheriff main..HEAD              # diff: that range, no plan
```

Positional, like every other command. An argument containing `..` is a range;
anything else is a path or a glob. The default is `document`'s:
`git diff --name-only $(git merge-base HEAD <default branch>)`, swept as a
snapshot of those files. An empty default scope is a one-line stop.

## Standalone — `/qoq sheriff`

Ungated: typing it is the opt-in.

1. **Dispatch `qoq-sheriff`** at the **session's** model with `mode: snapshot` or
   `diff`, the scope, and this skill's absolute path.
2. **`status: question`** → ask the user, re-dispatch with the answer verbatim.
3. **Print the report** — every finding with its severity, confidence,
   locations, reason and exploit — and say once, up top, that **intent was not
   judged**: there is no plan, so the sheriff can say what the code does but not
   whether anyone meant it. Nothing is written to disk.
4. **Offer remediation**, never start it. On the user's yes, per finding: the
   routing and the loop below, with two differences — the branch check runs
   first (on the default branch, ask; suggest `sheriff/<topic>`), and the
   re-gate is `qoq fix` over the touched files plus the project's full build and
   suite from the record, since there's no milestone union.

## Pipeline — from `execute`

**Experimental, so opt-in:** it runs only when `execute` was given `--sheriff`,
or the project's `qoq.config.*` sets `future: { unstable_skill_sheriff: true }`
([execute.md](execute.md), Setup). No skip rule: on, it sweeps every milestone,
spec-only ones included — a clean report on a small diff is cheap, and deciding
"nothing security-relevant here" is the judgment this agent exists to make.

### The milestone sweep

After the milestone gate is green, before `document`
([execute.md](execute.md)). Remediating code before the gates would spend
judgment on text that's about to change; after them, the sheriff sees what will
actually ship.

Dispatch at the **session's** model, cold — a fresh dispatch every time, never
`SendMessage` — with `mode: milestone`, the range
`<first ticket commit>^..<last ticket commit>` over **`done`** tickets only, the
union of their files, the milestone's Goal and Contracts and every ticket's
acceptance criteria, the plan's `**Security context:**` line if it has one, and
this skill's absolute path.

**`status: question`** stops the run: the sweep can't happen without the
answer, and the next milestone would build on code nobody swept. Ask, write the
answer into the plan header as `**Security context:** <answer>` (appending to an
existing line), and re-dispatch. Every later dispatch carries it, so it's never
asked twice.

### The per-ticket sweep

A ticket whose **Security sweep** is `ticket` gets an early sweep after Gate 2
and before its commit — `mode: ticket`, the working-tree diff of its `files`,
its own criteria. Auto-routed findings go back to the same developer as a
verbatim re-dispatch and spend that ticket's **delivery** attempts: it isn't
green-and-committed yet, so this is still delivery. Human-routed ones become
Security advisories now and are passed to the milestone sweep as already known.
The milestone sweep still covers the whole diff, this ticket included; the early
one replaces none of it.

### Routing

| Finding                            | Goes to                                                |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `confirmed` + `critical` or `high` | remediation, now — no question                         |
| `ambiguous` + `critical` or `high` | **the user, now** — the run stops at this gate         |
| anything `medium` or `low`         | a **Security advisory** — walked through at end of run |

A possible hole the next milestone will build on is worth stopping for; the rest
waits for the walkthrough so an unattended run keeps going. The user's options
for any finding put to them, now or at the end:

- **remediate** — into the loop below
- **accept** — this thread writes `qoq-sheriff: accepted — <the user's reason,
verbatim>` above the first location, in that file's comment syntax, and commits
  it alone as `chore(m<N>): accept security risk S<n>`. A file with no comment
  syntax (JSON) can't carry one: say so, and record it as **defer** instead,
  which re-raises on later runs
- **defer** — a ticket appended to the next milestone that hasn't started, with
  `Security sweep: ticket`, or to a new final milestone "Security follow-ups" when
  none is left; confirm the placement in the same question

An accepted marker comes back as an ambiguous finding when the diff touches it or
when another finding breaks the reason it states (`agents/qoq-sheriff.md`). It
routes like any other ambiguous finding. Put it to the user beside the finding
that broke it, since their answer to one usually settles the other. A
**remediate** answer removes the marker in the remediation ticket, and a fresh
**accept** replaces it with the new reason.

### Remediation

Not a loop back into the ticket: that ticket is delivered and green. A security
fix is a new, narrow job, and **its budget is two rounds**, counted apart from
any ticket's three delivery attempts — a hard ticket must not starve its own
security fix, and "the fix didn't work" is a different failure from "the ticket
was hard".

**One round** is: dispatch → scope check → Gate 1 → Gate 2 → re-gate → recheck.

1. **Write a remediation ticket** for every remediate-routed finding of this
   sweep, in the plan's ticket shape, appended under the milestone as
   `Ticket <N>.S<k>`:
   - **Files** — the findings' files, plus one new spec file. More than five
     files means one ticket per cluster of findings sharing files, run one after
     another inside the same round
   - **Acceptance criteria** — per finding, the exploit stated as an assertion
     that must now fail: "a signed-in user requesting another user's
     `/orders/:id` gets 404". A finding with no runtime exploit to assert — a
     secret in source, a token in a log — gets a static assertion: a spec that
     reads the file and asserts the secret or the logging call is gone. Never a
     criterion with no spec; that would be buying green
   - **Context** — the findings verbatim, and: change nothing outside these
     findings; a fix that needs more is a hand-back
   - **Agent tier** — `sonnet`; this is scoped mechanical work
2. **Dispatch `qoq-developer`** exactly as `execute` dispatches any ticket.
   Gate 1 or Gate 2 failing inside the round re-dispatches inside the round on
   the developer's own three attempts; only a finding surviving the recheck
   spends a round.
3. **Scope check, here, by file.** The developer's `files` and
   `git diff --name-only` must both be inside the ticket's **Files**. Any other
   file: `git restore` it, re-dispatch with the violation quoted, and the round
   is spent. Regions inside a file aren't checked here — the fix moves lines,
   and the recheck reads the diff.
4. **Gate 1, Gate 2, commit** as for any ticket —
   `fix(m<N>): security S1,S2`, `--no-verify`.
5. **Re-gate**: `qoq fix` over the milestone union with Knip on, plus the full
   build and suite. Not `qoq refactor`: its auto tier could reshape the fix.
   Red → the round is spent, the digest goes into the next dispatch.
6. **Recheck** — dispatch `qoq-sheriff` with `mode: recheck`, the findings
   verbatim and the remediation's range. `surviving` and any new finding route
   again by the table above.

**Two rounds spent with findings surviving** → bring the user each surviving
finding, both rounds' diffs and both rechecks' verdicts, and four options: one
more round at the session's model · accept · defer · stop the run.

Remediation tickets are **not** filed with `estimate.mjs` — no plan estimate
exists to grade — and on an imported plan they stay local: the tracker gets no
new issues, only the milestone's Security line through the write-back it already
has.

## What gets recorded

The milestone's Completed block gains **Security**: the sweep's verdict, then one
entry per finding — id, severity, and how it ended (remediated `<hash>`,
accepted, deferred to `<ticket>`, open advisory). **Gate evidence** gets the
sweep's one-line verdict beside the refactor and suite results.

**At the end of the run**, walk the user through every milestone's Security
advisories once, with the options above. A remediate answer runs the loop then,
on an already-archived milestone: its commits land after the archive, and its
Security line is updated in both the Completed block and `.completed.md` — the
one edit an archive takes, because a line still saying "open" about a fixed
finding is false.
