// Estimate calibration for `qoq plan` — kept out of prose for the same reason
// `stats.mjs` is: three call sites resolving a threshold by eye would each
// invent their own idea of what "keeps going wrong" means, and a mis-read
// threshold leaves nothing in the transcript to notice.
//
// An estimate is one decision with two halves — the t-shirt size and the model
// tier it gets delegated to. Outcomes are counted per tier inside the bucket,
// because "this shape of work is fine at sonnet and hopeless at haiku" is the
// sentence the record has to be able to say, and a tier-blind count can't.
//
// The bucket is the exact tag *combination* scoped to one tech stack, never a
// single tag and never a stack-blind average: `pattern-repeat` alone estimates
// fine, `pattern-repeat + architectural` may reliably blow up, and the same
// combination can be safe in React and hopeless in NestJS inside one repo.
//
// Two verdicts, and they read different columns:
//   - escalate — this tier keeps missing. Retries mean the model was too small,
//     and a bigger one is much the cheaper side of that mistake.
//   - split    — no tier delivers this bucket at all, even after `execute`
//     escalated as far as it could. That's the ticket being wrong, not the
//     model, and a bigger model fixes nothing.
//
// Usage:
//   estimate.mjs --tags a,b --stack react --size S --tier haiku [--project DIR]
//   estimate.mjs --record --tags a,b --stack react --tier haiku
//                --outcome success|failure --attempts N
//                --attribution estimation-miss|scope-expansion
//                [--summary "..."] [--project DIR]
//
// Exit code, estimate mode — branch on it rather than parsing the JSON:
//   0  the pick stands (in band, or too little data to argue)
//   1  keeps missing — take the dearer tier it returns, flag it for approval
//   2  split — this shape of ticket keeps going undelivered, decompose it
//   4  usage error
// Record mode: 0 recorded, 4 usage error.
