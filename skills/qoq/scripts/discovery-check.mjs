// Is the discovery record still good for this project?
//
// Every qoq command starts from the record. Dispatching `qoq-discovery` to
// re-verify it on every run costs an agent and a dozen file reads to confirm
// something nothing has touched, so this is the cheap gate in front of it: the
// record carries a hash of the inputs its answers came from, and a matching hash
// means nothing it describes has moved.
//
// Two inputs, and only the parts of them the record actually reads:
//
//   - package.json's `scripts` block. Every command field on the record quotes
//     one verbatim, and renaming one moves no lockfile at all — the record would
//     keep naming a script that no longer exists.
//   - the handful of dependencies the rest of the fields were read off — the qoq
//     CLI behind `run` and `check`, the test stack behind `runner` and `react` —
//     by name in package.json's dependencies, by the lines naming them in the
//     project's lockfile.
//
// Deliberately NOT the whole of either file. package.json's `version` moves on
// every release commit, and a lockfile moves whenever any transitive dependency
// does; neither changes a word of the record. Hashing them whole dispatched a
// discovery agent to re-confirm answers nothing had touched, which is the exact
// cost this gate exists to avoid. Versions of the watched packages are out for
// the same reason: `runner` is `vitest` at any version, and a qoq CLI upgrade
// deletes the record outright — it lives inside that package.
//
// A script rather than prose for the caller to carry out, because "has this
// project moved" has to mean one thing. Two callers eyeballing a lockfile will
// disagree, and the failure is silent: a stale record is read as current and
// every command after it runs on answers for a project that's gone.
//
// The skill's own agent files are deliberately NOT in here, though the project's
// copies of them do go stale when the skill upgrades. That's a different
// question with a different answer: scripts/sync-agents.mjs compares them file
// by file on every top-level run and reports its own verdict, so an upgraded
// skill refreshes the copies for the price of a few file reads. Hashing them
// here instead made a skill upgrade look like a moved dependency and dispatched
// a whole discovery agent to re-confirm project answers that hadn't changed —
// and every user gets a skill upgrade.
//
// When the record IS stale, this also derives the fields that are a matter of
// reading rather than judgement — the scripts block, which test stack is
// installed, whether the CLI is a workspace link — and hands them over as a
// proposal. `qoq-discovery` then checks a filled-in record and settles what's
// left, instead of deriving ten fields from scratch every time one dependency
// moved. The mechanical half was never the part that needed a model, and two
// implementations of it (one here to hash, one in the agent to derive) is how
// the two come to disagree.
//
// The derivation runs only after the hash has already failed, so the common
// path — a current record, which is nearly every run — pays none of it.
//
// Usage:   node discovery-check.mjs [--project <dir>]
//   --project   project root (default: cwd)
//
// Exit code: 0 the record is current — its JSON is on stdout, use it and
// dispatch nothing. 1 missing, unreadable, or derived from a different project
// state — stdout is `{ hash, proposed, unresolved }` for the agent's dispatch,
// stderr says which it was. 2 usage error. 3 the qoq CLI isn't installed, which
// stops the whole run: every command's spine is that binary, and dispatching an
// agent to discover its absence is a run spent learning what one `existsSync`
// already knew.
