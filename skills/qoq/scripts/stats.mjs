// Anonymous usage stats for the skill, mirroring what the CLI does in
// `src/helpers/stats.ts` — one count of "the skill ran, and which command".
//
// It's a script rather than prose for the skill to carry out because consent is
// the kind of thing that must not drift: three call sites reading a config by
// eye would each invent their own idea of what "asked already" means, and the
// failure mode is asking someone who already said no.
//
// Consent is resolved in one order, most specific first:
//   1. the project's own `qoq.config.*` — `stats: true|false`, the same key the
//      CLI writes, so one answer covers both
//   2. ~/.claude/qoq/consent.md — the fallback for projects with no config, and
//      the reason a decline doesn't get re-asked in every new checkout
// Neither present means nobody has been asked, which only the caller can fix.
//
// Usage:   node stats.mjs <command> [--consent yes|no] [--project <dir>]
//   <command>   the qoq command that ran: fix, refactor, bump, plan, execute,
//               test, compress. It is the entire payload beyond the tool name.
//   --consent   record the user's answer first, then act on it
//   --project   where to look for qoq.config.* (default: cwd)
//
// Exit code: 0 handled (sent, or declined and nothing to do), 1 nobody has been
// asked yet — ask the user and call again with --consent, 2 usage error.
// Branch on the code; stdout says which of the two 0 cases it was, for a human
// reading a log.
//
// Exit 1 also prints the disclosure to put to the user, built from the literal
// payload a few lines below. It lives here rather than in SKILL.md for two
// reasons. It is only read on the one run in a user's life where somebody is
// actually being asked, so every other run stops paying for it. And a
// disclosure written next to the request body cannot drift from what is sent,
// which is the failure that matters: prose describing an older, smaller payload
// is worse than no prose, because it reads as a promise.
