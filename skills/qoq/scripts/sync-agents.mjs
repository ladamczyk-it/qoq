// Install this skill's agents into the project's .claude/agents/.
//
// The six agent files live inside the skill, next to the references that
// dispatch them — but a skill registers no agents, and neither does a plugin
// that keeps them there. Claude Code loads plugin agents from real files in
// <plugin-root>/agents/ only: an "agents": [...] list in the manifest passes
// `claude plugin validate` and then loads nothing, and symlinks in that
// directory are skipped. So the skill installs them where the project's own
// agents live, and stays the single source of truth for their contents.
//
// Runs at the head of every top-level run, before the discovery gate, because
// it is the only thing that notices a skill upgrade: the record's hash covers
// the project, and a new version of an agent moves nothing there. Comparing six
// small files costs nothing next to the discovery run that hashing them into the
// record used to trigger.
//
// Claude Code picks the directory up on its own, a short delay after the files
// land — measured here as slower than the same turn and faster than a minute, so
// a dispatch immediately after this runs can still miss. That's what the line it
// prints is for: the caller tells the user the agents arrived, and the
// `general-purpose` fallback in SKILL.md covers whatever fires before they
// register. Nothing here needs a restart, and nothing depends on the timing.
//
// This writes into the user's own repo, usually into a tracked directory, so it
// has to be able to tell its own last copy from a file the user edited. It
// can't do that by comparing against the current source — every skill upgrade
// makes an untouched copy differ too. So each install records the digest of what
// it wrote in `.qoq-agents.json` beside the files:
//
//   digest matches   → our copy, untouched. Overwrite it.
//   digest differs   → the user edited it. Leave it, and say so — silently
//                      reverting somebody's customisation on a routine run is
//                      the one thing this script must never do.
//
// No manifest at all is the one case that gets adopted rather than protected:
// it means an install that predates this file, which is every existing project
// on the first run after the upgrade that shipped it. Protecting those would
// freeze every one of them on the agent bodies it already had and never ship
// another, which is worse than the hazard. So the first run refreshes and
// records; every run after it can tell the difference.
//
// An agent the skill stops shipping is removed the same way, and only under the
// same proof: it's in the manifest, so we wrote it, and the copy on disk is
// still byte-for-byte the one we wrote. Left behind, it stays registered and
// dispatchable with a contract that no longer exists anywhere — worse than a
// stale copy, because nothing in the skill mentions it any more.
//
// The one exception is a symlink with nothing on the other end. A checkout that
// symlinks its agents never appears in the manifest, so the removal above can't
// see it — but a dangling link points at nothing, so there is no edit to lose and
// no reason to keep a file Claude Code will try to parse as an agent.
//
// A symlinked target is left alone regardless. That's a checkout pointing at the
// source files deliberately, and overwriting it with a copy would silently
// freeze the next edit out of every dispatch.
//
// Usage:   node sync-agents.mjs [--project <dir>]
//   --project   project root (default: cwd)
//
// Exit 0 with one line on stdout, for the caller to pass through verbatim:
// `agents current`, `agents installed: <names>`, `agents removed: <names>`,
// and/or `agents kept (edited here): <names>`. Exit 2 usage error.
