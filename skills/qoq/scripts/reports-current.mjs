// Are the reports in <report-dir> still current for <scope>?
//
// `qoq fix` calls qoq-checker at the top of every loop, and re-running every
// tool each time is the most expensive thing in the system. This is the cheap
// answer: an mtime comparison. Reports are current only when the OLDEST report
// on disk is newer than the NEWEST file in scope — one source file touched
// after one report was written makes the whole set stale.
//
// It's a script rather than a paragraph of prose for the checker to carry out,
// because a wrong answer here is silent: a stale digest read as current makes
// `fix` declare PASS over code nothing checked.
//
// Usage:   node reports-current.mjs <report-dir> <scope...>
//   <report-dir>  where `qoq --check --json` wrote its reports
//   <scope...>    files or directories the verdict is about; a bare `qoq fix`
//                 passes qoq.config's srcPath
//
// Exit code: 0 current (reuse them), 1 stale or missing (re-run the check),
// 2 usage error. Branch on the code; stdout is for humans reading a log.
